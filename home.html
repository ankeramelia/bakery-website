        <h2>Welcome to hearth & Crumb</h2>
        <p>At Hearth & Crumb, every bite is meant to feel like home. Inspired by the comforting aroma of freshly baked bread and the sweetness of shared moments, we craft treats that bring people together.
        <br>
        From golden loaves to delicate cupcakes, each creation is made with passion, patience, and the finest ingredients — blending traditional techniques with a touch of modern indulgence.
        <br>
        Whether you’re here for a buttery croissant, a decadent slice of cake, or just good coffee and company, our hearth is warm, our doors open, and our joy is baked into every crumb.
